# Teaching Resources

If you've ended up here, you've been granted access by Corinna! Welcome :-) This repo is intended for teaching purposes only, so please use it for such! I've dropped all my teaching notes here, as well as beginning and ending code for my study groups. I'll add in some other links that might help as well. You'll notice this is the old curriculum, not flipped. Please use and share as necessary. 

(Please also ignore any snarky comments I've made to myself in my teaching notes. My sense of humor tends to be a bit weird.)

#### Other Review Guides
Note: These were filled out by one of my former students who was a teacher. These are *incredibly* thorough and I prefer not to give them to my students, but they're a GREAT source of supplemental information. I think students do a better job on their reviews when they prep for them on their own, and reinforce the information through studying (duh ðŸ™„). But they're here if you want them ðŸ˜‰
